## Intro
Project templating made easy using Github templates. Think of it as create-react-app for any project type you could think of.

## Usage
* Get an Github access token to be able to retrieve your repos
* Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
* Note: Only 'template repositories' will be listed in the CLI

## TODO
* Allow users to use other Github users templates

## What does Modelo mean?
Modelo is Portuguese for template. I chose the name because I have a good friend from Portugal, who recently lost a loved one due to cancer.

It would be awesome if you made a donation to cancer research here(or anywhere else for that matter): https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/donate#/
